Bible Refutation By lai#4337 and Lightt#7781


﷽


First off, Muslims believe the Torah (Torwah), Zabur (Psalms) and Bible (Gospel) exist, but the ones that were sent down at the same date they were, are the most reliable 
because they have not been changed. Although, The Torah and Bible have been corrupted overtime and till this day they are, but the Torah isn’t the main topic here, the Bible is.

The first languages of the bible were Greek, Biblical Herbew and Aramic. It was revealed to Isa Bin Maryam (Jesus the son of Mary) or Prophet Isa (PBUH).

There are currently many versions of the bible, which one should we pick? Which one should we trust?

As of September 2020 the full Bible has been translated into 704 languages, the New Testament has been translated into an additional 1,551 languages and Bible portions or 
stories into 1,160 other languages. Thus at least some portions of the Bible have been translated into 3,415 languages.

Have you ever seen a religious text that has multiple versions that are slightly different and with corrupted translations? Yes, The bible.

This shows and proves that Jesus (Isa ibnu maryam AS) is not god as well as him being a prophet John 14:28 John 14:16  Mathew 21:11 Acts 2:22 Mathew 4:10 John 10:29
Luke 24:19 Luke 11:20 Mark 13:32 Mark 13:32 Luke 6:12 Matthew 26:39, Matthew 26:39 is jesus asking help from the father, If jesus is all being and omnipresent why is he 
asking help from the father when he is a prophet that you guys call god and pray to? This shows that your beliefs are mistaken and corrupt. 

Mark 11:26 is not in the revised standard version bible as well as many other versions not having other verses,    as well as Luke 17:36 is also removed from the NIV version. 

Numbers 23:19 and John 5:27 is a contradiction, if you refer to numbers 23:19 as Jesus saying he is not like man then that proves another human error in translating 
which proves for the bible to be corrupt. 

Mark 15:22 and John 19:14-15 is another contradiction straight forward, easy read we don't need to explain.
